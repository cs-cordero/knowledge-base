# std140 Layout

For `Uniform` blocks in the rendering pipeline, WGPU follows OpenGL's `std140` layout rules, which are strictly defined.

| Variable type | Size and Alignment |
|:---:|:---:|
| Scalar `bool`, `int`, `uint`, `float`, and `double` | Both the size and alignment are the siz eof the scalar in basic machine types. |
| `ivec2` | Both the size and alignment are twice the size of the underlying scalar type. |
| `vec3` and `vec4` | Both the size and alignment are 4x the size of the underlying scalar type. Note: the underlying scalar type is usually going to be `float`, which has size and alignment `4`.
| An array of scalars or vectors | The size and alignment of each element in the array will be the size of the element type, _rounded up to the multiple of the size of a `vec4`.  The array's size will be this rounded-up element size times the count of elements in the array. |
| `mat4` or `mat4[]` | Same layout as an array of N vectors each with R components (for column-major matrices) or C components (for row-major matrices).
| `struct` or `struct[]` | Structure alignment will be the alignment for the biggest structure member, rounded up to a multiple of the size of a `vec4`.  Each structure will start on this alignment, and its size will be the space needed by its members, according tot he previous rules, rounded up to a multiple of the structure alignment. |
